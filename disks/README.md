#Floppy discs
------------

The format of the floppy disc image is specified in the .config file.

The format of this file is similar to the Flash Floppy IMG.CFG file used for the Gotek images.

    https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/wiki/IMG.CFG-Configuration-File

although not all the options have been implimented.

# The disks provided

* cpm001system22.config - CPM 2.2 boot disk
* cpm3.config   - original CPM 3 boot disk
* cpm3seq.config - CPM3 boot disk with Y2k fix.

    # image config file for CPM2 disc

* imagefilename=filename

* cyls = 1 to 255

    the number of cylinders ( aka tracks ) in the image
    
* heads = 1 or 2

    the number of heads ( aka sides ) in the image
    
* secs = 0 to 255

    the number of sectors per track
    
* bps = 128 | 256 | 512 | 1024 | 2048 | 4096 | 8192

    The number of bytes per sector
    
* id = 0-255 

    The ID of the first sector on each track
    Successive sectors are numbered sequentially upwards

* file-layout = interleaved* | sequential | reverse-sideN | sides-swapped

    ** Image file track layout
    ** Multiple values can be specified, separated by commas (eg. sequential,reverse-side1)
    ** sequential: Sequential cylinder ordering: all side 0, then side 1
    ** interleaved: Interleaved cylinder ordering: c0s0, c0s1, c1s0, c1s1, ...
    ** reverse-sideN: Side-N cylinders are in reverse order (high to low) (N=0,1)
    ** sides-swapped: Sides 0 and 1 ordering is swapped in the image file
