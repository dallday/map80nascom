Map80 Nascom Emulator

#Bios Monitor
#------------

The bios monitor can be run before or after running the Z80 emulator and it provides a means of looking at, and amending the RAM being used by the emulator.

To activate the biosmonitor use the -x option when calling the emulator. It will bring up the 2 windows and load all the files as per a normal run, 
but it will then show the Bios: prompt.
NOTE:- you may have to ensure the terminal window is the acrive window before any commands can be used.
