calling  map80nascom - do it from command line.

Note:- the 2 emulator windows will appear at the top of the screen, so ensure you command line is at the bottom or to the right.
once called you can exit it by pressing F4 - but make sure that one of the emulator windows are selected.
If in the command line window press cntrl + c 
or just close the emulator window.

Use ./map80nascom -? to get all the options 

To run with NASSYS3 just do 

./map80nascom

This will load  
    roms/nassys3.nas - into the Nascom 2 rom space
    roms/vfcrom0.nas - into the VFC rom space
and then run NASSYS3

To load additional .nas files into memory just list then after the program and options 
./map80nascom -v progs/clock.nas progs/clkwr.nas

You can load a .cas file by using the -i option and then using the R option once in NASSYS3
 
./map80nascom -v -i progs/clock.cas

Note - it does not keep the file open so you can replace the file and then use F3 to restart a new file.
You can also use ln to link a dummy file to the actual input file you want to use.

call ./map80nascom -v -i serial.cas
then 
ln -s progs/clkwr.cas serial.cas
do a R in nassys
then
rm serial
ln -s progs/clock.cas serial.cas
do F3 in nassys
do a R in nassys
