If you try and run it you might get 
bash: permissions denied
This normally means one of the libraries is missing 

You can see if libraries needed by using ldd map80nascom

On a clean install on ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS I need to get the following to "make" the program

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt install make
sudo apt install gcc

not sure if this was needed needed :-
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-2.0-0


the program should well run using ./map80nascom

if not do 
make clean
make 

and it should build a new one.
