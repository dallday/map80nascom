The roms folder is used to keep all the Z80 code needed to run the emulator.

The .nal and .nas are Nascom ascii format files, not sure why some as .nal.

The current files are:

* **basic.nal** Nascom2 Basic. Thanks to http://www.nascomhomepage.com/ 

* **nassys3.nal** NASSYS3.  Extracted from my system.

* **PolyDos_2_Boot_ROM.nas** The boot rom for PolyDos 2.
    Thanks to Neal Crook - https://github.com/nealcrook/nascom/tree/master/PolyDos/rom

* **vfcrom0.nas** The boot rom for the vfc card.
    The VFC vfcrom0.nas was extracted from my system.
